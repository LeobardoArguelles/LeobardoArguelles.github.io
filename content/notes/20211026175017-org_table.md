To group columns, or to draw vertical lines in the table, add an extra row
below the headers, and use the following commands:

-   `/` In the first cell of the extra row, to indicate that the row is used for delimiting column groups.
-   `<` To start a group.
-   `>` To end a group.
-   `<>` To make a column a group of its own.

Note: It is also valid to just use the `<` group starter command. Org is
smart enough to process it correctly.

Example:

| Horas    || 0    | 0    | 2    | 3    | 3    | 5    | 8    | 8    | 10   | 12   |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Promedio || 3.49 | 3.05 | 3.24 | 2.82 | 3.19 | 2.78 | 2.31 | 2.54 | 2.03 | 2.51 |
