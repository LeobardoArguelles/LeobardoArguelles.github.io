The most popular programming paradigm, and one of the most importants.
It relies on the concepts of **classes** and **objects**.


## CLASSES {#classes}

It is like a _blueprint_, which is used to create the objects.
Clases are broad categories. Car, Dog, Animal are common examples.


### ATTRIBUTES {#attributes}

A class is a kind of object that will share attributes with other objects
of the same class. And though the attribute is the same, the value
changes.

E.g.

-   Class: Car.
    -   Attribute: Color
        -   Car1.color = red.
        -   Car2.color = blue.


### METHODS {#methods}

These are functions that are available only to objects of the class.
Methods are the actions that an object of a specific class can perform.

For example, a object of the class Car could have a `repaint` method,
which changes its `color` attribute.


## OBJECTS {#objects}

An object is an instantiation of a class. It will have all its attributes,
with a value.
