## MAKE ATOMIC CARDS {#make-atomic-cards}

One idea per card:

-   Be specific, break up big ideas into smaller ones.
-   Or, condense multiple ideas into a higher level one (this is harder).


## BE HOLISTIC {#be-holistic}

That is, integrate an idea into your knowledge _before_ putting it into
Anki:

> Have holistic ideas, but atomic flashcards.


## FUTURE-PROOF YOUR CARDS {#future-proof-your-cards}

Don't think that remembering something know equals to remembering it in
the future, with the same level of detail.

Future-proof your decks by:

-   Add more specifiers
-   Add more context


## ANATOMY OF A GOOD CARD {#anatomy-of-a-good-card}

They usually must have:

-   A question (not a statement).
    Make it specific and with context
-   The answer
    Duh.
