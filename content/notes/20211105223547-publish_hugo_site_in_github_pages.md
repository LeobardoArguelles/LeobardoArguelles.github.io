1.  Create a repository in your github account named: <github\_username>.github.io
    Don't have a github account? Well, create one.
    Don't add any of the freebies included in the repo (License, readme, etc...)
2.  [Link the repository]({{<relref "20211105183843-git_add_repo_from_local.md#" >}}) with the directory that has your Hugo files.
3.  In the main directory of your site, create the directories and the file ".github/workflows/gh-pages.yml"
    This is a default path for github to look for "gh-pages.yml"
4.  Inside "gh-pages.yml", add the code from the [appendix](#appendix-git-action-code).
5.  In the main directory, run `hugo`.
    Just like that, a "./public" directory should appear.
6.  Add, commit, and push to main.
    The github action that you loaded in "gh-pages.yml" will
    build the site for you, from your files in "./public"
7.  Go to your github pages settings
    Located as of 2021/11/05 in:
    <https://github.com/><Username>/<Username>.github.io/settings/pages
8.  Change the branch that the site will build from. It might be set to "main", chang it to "gh-pages"
    ![](/ox-hugo/branch.png)
9.  Now it should be published correctly.
