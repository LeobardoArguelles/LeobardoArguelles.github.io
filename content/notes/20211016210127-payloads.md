The payload is the code we use when running an exploit.
These are sent to the victim, to try and get a shell.


## NON-STAGED {#non-staged}

Sends the exploit all at once. It is larger in size, and doesn't always work.

Meterpreter path example: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`


## STAGED {#staged}

Sends the payload in stages, and can be less stable.

Meterpreter path example: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
