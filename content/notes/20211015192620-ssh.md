## NORMAL CONNECTION {#normal-connection}

```shell
ssh <ip_address>
# Example: ssh 192.168.57.134
```


## ALTERNATIVE METHOD {#alternative-method}

Sometimes, when we dont have the key, we will need to do this process:

First, try the normal connection: `ssh <ip_address>`.
This shoul throw an error, and it should give you an "offer" of a key
exchange. Copy it, and use it in the next line:

```shell
ssh <ip_address> -oKexAlgorithms=+<key_exchange>
```

This should also throw an error, and it should also offer a "matchin cipher".
Likewise, copy it, and add it:

```shell
ssh <ip_address> -oKexAlgorithms=+<key_exchange> -c <cipher>
```
