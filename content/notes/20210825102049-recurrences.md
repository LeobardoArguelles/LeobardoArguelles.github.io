It is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value
on smaller inputs.


## Solving recurrences {#solving-recurrences}


### Substitution method {#substitution-method}

We guess a bound and then use mathematical induction to prove if it is correct.


### Recursion-tree method {#recursion-tree-method}

It converts the recurrence into a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at
various levels of the recursion.
To solve it, we use techniques for bounding summations.


### Master method {#master-method}

Provides bounds for recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
