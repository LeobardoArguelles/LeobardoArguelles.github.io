This is a file that holds metadata and information related with a project,
which is usually used with the Node.js framework.

The package.json will **always** be structured in json format.


## COMMON METADATA {#common-metadata}

This are the keywords used inside the file:

-   name
    Name of the project
-   version
    Version of the project
-   description
    Text descripiton of the project
-   main
    The main file (?)
-   license
    The license for the project


## DEPENDENCIES {#dependencies}

These are the packages which your project depends on.
It is useful to declare them on the `package.json` file, because then you
can simply install them using npm.

Also, these dependencies can be separated if they are required for
production or for development.


## EXAMPLE {#example}

```json
{
    "name": "myProject" ,
    "version": "0.01",
    "description": "My test project",
    "main": "index.js",
    "license": "MIT",
    "devDependencies": {
        "mocha": "~3.1",
        "navite-hello-world": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "fill-keys": "^1.0.2",
        "module-not-found-error": "^1.0.0"
